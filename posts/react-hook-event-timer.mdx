# Harnessing the power of an infinite loop

I think most beginners would echo the sentiment that React's effect hook is laden with opportunities to infinitely
re-render your app until the browser throws a fit and gives up. I spent the better part of a month dealing with
infinitely re-rendering effect hooks before it all clicked, and even still I rely heavily on linters to inform me of
what dependencies are needed for the damn thing. One of the issues is that the bulk of information on the internet
surrounding `useEffect()` is related to data fetching in a way that mimics `onComponentDidMount()` from the days of
class-based components. It's a novel pattern we've all seen:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const [response, setResponse] = useState()

useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/service/01234')
        .then(/* ... */)
        .then(data => setResponse(data))
}, [])
```

Ah! There it is. Did you catch it? The empty set of brackets as a second parameter to the effect hook is the empty
dependency array. This is usually the first way we learn to fetch data, and also our first introduction to effect
hooks. Soon after, you might encounter your first need for a dependency, such as updating state based on previous
state or another state item. Consider the same use as above, with alterations:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const [response, setResponse] = useState()
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

useEffect(() => {
    if (loading) {
        fetch('/api/service/01234')
        .then(/* ... */)
        .then(data => {
            setResponse(data)
            setLoading(false)
        })
    }
}, [loading])
```

## Is that a... dependency?!

WAIT! What's that in our dependency array?! I only want to run this once on page load, right?? Is this still going to do that?
Well, yes and no. This effect will _fetch_ once, but your `setLoading()` state change will very much trigger it a second time.
It's a sticky situation, utilizing and setting state from an effect. But this pitfall, while it annoys the living daylights out
of beginners learning hooks, can be useful at times.

During the creation of this blog, there was an idea to implement a minimal "Featured" banner on the main list that would point
readers to the blog posts I most wanted them to read. The challenge posed was to cycle through cards on a timed rotation. There
are countless ways to accomplish this, but my approach was in the spirit of minimalism. Rather than animating and swiping
through a rendered set of feature cards, I'd just set them all to `display: none` until it was their turn in the rotation.
Similarly, I conditionally style the indicator in the indicator group with a more opaque appearance. So, what does this have to
do with infinitely re-rendering hooks?

Well, what is an infinitely re-rendering component but a stray recursion? Much like you can harness recursion, you can harness
and infinite loop by making it _think_ before it goes and calls itself yet again. I had this thought
while considering my approach and immediately began to draw up the developer experience I wanted to have. I had a few
known requirements: I wanted a clean, configurable implementation; I wanted it to be configurable in various units of time,
and I wanted the output to just be a simple binary switch, nothing complex. Here's why:

## The approach

You never want a tricky or overly complex developer experience in the name of functionality, in my opinion. I advocate for
treating developers kindly, so I knew I didn't want to have to think about converting any units outside this timer. After
all would you buy a clock that only let you read the time in milliseconds from 1970? With that in mind, I started to design
the input. Building this way is very similar to how I build apps in general; prototype the user experience, then plug it in
to the API. The input here is representative of the user, or in this case _developer_, experience. Look how easy this is:

```typescript
import useEventTimer from "./useEventTimer";
const { trigger } = useEventTimer({ seconds: 10 })
```

Why use an object for parameters? Why destructure the `trigger` variable rather than just returning it? Do I have some kind
of curly brace fetish? Two-thirds of those are great questions, and the answer to the last is yes, BUT that isn't why I did it
this way. There's two reasons, the first of which is it allowed for the developer to define time in a unit of their choice
without defining the other units. Consider the above approach compared to `useEventTimer(0, 0, 10, 0)`. Since this is markdown
and not your IDE, you have no clue what that means. Named variables in TypeScript are best done through an interface (object)
as a parameter.

### Parameters as objects

```typescript
interface EventTimerConfig {
    milliseconds: number
    seconds: number
    minutes: number
    hours: number
}
type EventTimerParams = Partial<EventTimerConfig>
const useEventTimer = (params: EventTimerParams) => //...
```

Now, there are a few things going on here. For one, all of our fields in `EventTimerConfig` are required, but I just said
our hook would accept `{ seconds: 10 }` as a valid parameter. What gives?! Well, you're `Partial`ly right. See, what I did
there? Okay, so, one of the perks of using TS in my daily work is that I find these cool shortcuts that I really like, such
as `Partial<T>`, which takes whatever generic type you give it and makes every field optional. Why do this over defining them
all as optional? Well, what if I want to reuse this somewhere and need to assert all required attributes are present? I have
a general rule: any interface or type with all optional values should not be defined as such, but rather should be given a
`Partial<T>` type that is used instead. Interfaces with one or more always-required, by all means, fill them with optional
attributes! Or proxy it accordingly; `Partial<Omit<T, "attributeToOmit">>` ... but that's a lesson for another time.

Regardless, the second, and more interesting, reason is because I also want to make units easily stackable. When we get to the hook
you'll see this compiles down to a `constantTime` variable that is calculated in milliseconds. So what happens when you pass
a parameter object like `{ minutes: 3, seconds: 30 }`? You get a trigger transmission every 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Just a fun
extra little feature. Conversely, if you wanted to do it the hard way, you could pass `{ seconds: 3 * 60 + 30 }` but look at it.
Do you see why we have this config object, now?
